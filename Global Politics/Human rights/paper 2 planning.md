# To what extent do the complex ==realities== and ==relationships== of ==power== in global politics make the concept of ==human rights== an ==unachievable== ideal?
## Introduction
### Definitions
#### Human rights
Human rights are a complex concept. The original definitions of human rights are based on the concept of 'natural law', the idea that humans have "an essential nature that dictates certain human goods (friendship, life, work play) that are desired always and everywhere" (Lamy p.272). Natural law forms the basis of human rights, which are more "modern" and "secular" (Heywood 311). It is accepted that, according to Heywood "human rights are set out in a collection of UN and other treaties and conventions". 
#### Power
According to Joseph Nye, "power is a contested concept"; there is no one definition that unites all views on power. A popular view of power is derived from Nye's separation of power into 3 sub-concepts. Hard power is a use of direct coercion or force, soft power is the use of persuasion or influence and smart power is a combination of the two to achieve ends more effectively (Murphy).
### Answer the question
- Interdependence 
- Billiard ball model
- Power relationships
- State sovereignty
- Realism.
- To what extent, so we are talking about a scale. 
- One end of the scale: liberalism, other end: realism
- Selfish human nature
- Relational power
- NEOLIBERALISM (is at odds with human rights ðŸ¤¯)
- The war on terror
- US hegemony 

### Main points
The key issue that makes human rights an unachievable ideal is that the perpetrator of human rights abuses (the state) is the very same actor that, since states have total independent control over their own territory, must punish violations.
## Body
The concept of humanitarian intervention is in contradiction with the concept of founding concept of state sovereignty. The Westphalian state-system, the "beginning of international politics" (Heywood) established the concept that states "have independent control over what happens within their territory" (Heywood). This fact makes it extremely difficult to punish a state for human rights violations without the use of hard power, violating their sovereignty and causing civil unrest. Some kind of global governance is required to be able to enforce human rights in a fair and predictable manner. In 2011, the United States led interventions into Libya to combat, according to the US, human rights violations in the state. The interventions in Libya heavily involved the military. Air and missile strikes were used, some Libyan citizens labelled the intervention as 'war' (Heywood). This kind of intervention is a clear violation of Libya's sovereignty and the retaliation no doubt killed many people. It may be argued that this particular intervention was a failure due to its military nature and possible ulterior motives (Heywood). This notion that human rights are unachievable due to complexity of enforcement and intrenched beliefs in the Westphalian state-system may be refuted by the liberal who believes that the movement of power away from the state and toward the collective power of IGO's such as the UN. One may argue that this collective power that is exercised often by the UN and other bodies form the consequences for human rights abuses. This however, assumes that the members of the UN, especially veto powers are acting in the interest of human rights.

Humanitarian interventions may have ulterior motives, undermining human rights ideals and causing further civil unrest in a state. As Heywood explains,

#### Examples: 
- War on terror
- Intervention in Libya
### Human rights have been solidified in international laws and treaties, overcoming the complex power relationships.
#### Examples: 
- Dr Congo child soldiers
- Cambodia human trafficking 



#### Examples: 
- The UN and NATO IGOs
