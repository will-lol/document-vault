# To what extent do the complex ==realities== and ==relationships== of ==power== in global politics make the concept of ==human rights== an ==unachievable== ideal?
## Introduction
### Definitions
#### Human rights
Human rights are a complex concept. The original definitions of human rights are based on the concept of 'natural law', the idea that humans have "an essential nature that dictates certain human goods (friendship, life, work play) that are desired always and everywhere" (Lamy p.272). Natural law forms the basis of human rights, which are more "modern" and "secular" (Heywood 311). It is accepted that, according to Heywood "human rights are set out in a collection of UN and other treaties and conventions". 
#### Power
According to Joseph Nye, "power is a contested concept"; there is no one definition that unites all views on power. A popular view of power is derived from Nye's separation of power into 3 sub-concepts. Hard power is a use of direct coercion or force, soft power is the use of persuasion or influence and smart power is a combination of the two to achieve ends more effectively (Murphy).
### Answer the question
- Interdependence 
- Billiard ball model
- Power relationships
- State sovereignty
- Realism.
- To what extent, so we are talking about a scale. 
- One end of the scale: liberalism, other end: realism
- Selfish human nature
- Relational power
- NEOLIBERALISM (is at odds with human rights ðŸ¤¯)
- The war on terror
- US hegemony 

The United States hegemony, its ideologies and consequences makes the concept of human rights a moderately unachievable ideal throughout the world.
### Main points
1. Neoliberalism and capitalism is at odds with human rights (page 101)
2. The War on Terror was not a venture compatible with human rights
3. The United States hegemony and its power over the world has made it the 'police' of human rights -- defining laws (UN) and consequences (NATO). This hegemonic status is at odds with the universality of human rights, allows the US to provide exemptions for themselves when it suits (war on terror).
