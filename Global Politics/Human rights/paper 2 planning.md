# To what extent do the complex ==realities== and ==relationships== of ==power== in global politics make the concept of ==human rights== an ==unachievable== ideal?
## Introduction
### Definitions
#### Human rights
Human rights are a complex concept. The original definitions of human rights are based on the concept of 'natural law', the idea that humans have "an essential nature that dictates certain human goods (friendship, life, work play) that are desired always and everywhere" (Lamy p.272). Natural law forms the basis of human rights, which are more "modern" and "secular" (Heywood 311). It is accepted that, according to Heywood "human rights are set out in a collection of UN and other treaties and conventions". 
#### Power
According to Joseph Nye, "power is a contested concept"; there is no one definition that unites all views on power. A popular view of power is derived from Nye's separation of power into 3 sub-concepts. Hard power is a use of direct coercion or force, soft power is the use of persuasion or influence and smart power is a combination of the two to achieve ends more effectively (Murphy).
