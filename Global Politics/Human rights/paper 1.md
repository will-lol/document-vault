# Paper 1 â€” Humanitarian Intervention
## 1. Identify ==three main points== made by U.S. President Barack Obama in Source A about the issue of ==international intervention== in Libya
1. International intervention has the ability to stop violence in Libya
2. International intervention must work in cooperation with Libya and not with military force to be successful
3. Using military power to overthrow the regime in Libya 'would be a mistake'. Non-military force is better in this case
## 2. With ==explicit reference== to Source B, explain why humanitarian intervention can often be the cause of protests and ==controversy==
Resentment to humanitarian intervention is often the product of patriotism/allegiance and faith to ones state. This is evident in use of the word "foreign" on the sign, which connotes a divide between outside and in, that when viewed from the inside can feel demeaning or even like war. 

The theme of war continues in this poster and is best demonstrated by the military imagery that surrounds the words. The military is a common staple of humanitarian intervention which becomes problematic due to it's violent nature that makes humanitarian intervention feel much less like a helping hand. 

Humanitarian intervention may also be ill advised or have ulterior motives. Intervening countries may take the opportunity of framing an exercise of military power as humanitarian intervention to take advantage of a state in jeopardy. A fear of this is expressed in the statement 'Libyan people can manage it alone'. 

The use of a fist connotes a solidarity between Libyan people against foreign intervention. In a civil conflict, the people of a state may be unhappy with an outcome involving foreign intervention. They may prefer to have their side of the conflict win. Humanitarian intervention to seek peace may be at odds with the wants of the people.
## 3. Contrast the views of Source C and Source D regarding the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention.
Source C establishes two parts to the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention: the 'ends' and the 'means'. Source C suggests that the ends of humanitarian intervention must be lawful and humanitarian, however, the means, war, is a mismatch with this end. Source C is able to suggest that war is an unsuitable end because wars result in the death of many civilians. Source D does not necessarily disagree with either the means or the ends of humanitarian intervention, but does agree with the fact that the ends used in Libya were unsuitable. Source C and source D disagree on the realities of these means and ends. Source D seems to suggest that the means for humanitarian intervention are usually appropriate and the justifications for war in the case of Libya were a product of many stars aligning. Source C suggests that the 'military means' are a persistent problem that is 'undermining our capacity to address growing insecurity'. 

Source C does not suggest that the ends for humanitarian intervention are nothing but humanitarian and lawful in reality. Source D's explicit references to the number of ends that live outside of humanitarianism seem to suggest that reality differs from strictly humanitarian ends. Source D mentions Gaddafi as a 'villain figure who had managed to alienate nearly all UN member states', the weakness of leaders in the middle east, a lack of interest from usual opposing veto powers, the smallness of Libya, and a convenient ground force to fight the war as potential legitimising factors for the case in Libya.
## 4. Using the sources and your own knowledge, evaluate the claim that violations of human rights are no guarantee that humanitarian intervention will take place.
1. Source D: humanitarian intervention and ulterior motives. Humanitarian reasoning must be paired with another motive to be justified by a state. the law!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2. Source C: "classic military means is undermining our capacity to address growing insecurity"
3. Source B: people within the state may not want humanitarian intervention
4. Source A: diplomacy is slow? choices to be made. 

Humanitarian intervention was a foreign concept in the state system, which is traditionally against intervention. Humanitarian intervention is unpredictable and inconsistent in where it is enacted. It is subject to the biases and the will of states to intervene. IGO's and International law have made attempts to standardise the conditions under which humanitarian intervention is justified, but it has failed to make a 'guarantee' for humanitarian intervention (Heywood 2014).
