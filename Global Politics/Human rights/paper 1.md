# Paper 1 — Humanitarian Intervention
## 1. Identify ==three main points== made by U.S. President Barack Obama in Source A about the issue of ==international intervention== in Libya
1. International intervention has the ability to stop violence in Libya
2. International intervention must work in cooperation with Libya and not with military force to be successful
3. Using military power to overthrow the regime in Libya 'would be a mistake'. Non-military force is better in this case
## 2. With ==explicit reference== to Source B, explain why humanitarian intervention can often be the cause of protests and ==controversy==
Resentment to humanitarian intervention is often the product of patriotism/allegiance and faith to ones state. This is evident in use of the word "foreign" on the sign, which connotes a divide between outside and in, that when viewed from the inside can feel demeaning or even like war. 

The theme of war continues in this poster and is best demonstrated by the military imagery that surrounds the words. The military is a common staple of humanitarian intervention which becomes problematic due to it's violent nature that makes humanitarian intervention feel much less like a helping hand. 

Humanitarian intervention may also be ill advised or have ulterior motives. Intervening countries may take the opportunity of framing an exercise of military power as humanitarian intervention to take advantage of a state in jeopardy. A fear of this is expressed in the statement 'Libyan people can manage it alone'. 

The use of a fist connotes a solidarity between Libyan people against foreign intervention. In a civil conflict, the people of a state may be unhappy with an outcome involving foreign intervention. They may prefer to have their side of the conflict win. Humanitarian intervention to seek peace may be at odds with the wants of the people.
## 3. Contrast the views of Source C and Source D regarding the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention.
Source C establishes two parts to the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention: the 'ends' and the 'means'. Source C suggests that the ends of humanitarian intervention must be lawful and humanitarian, however, the means, war, is a mismatch with this end. Source C is able to suggest that war is an unsuitable end because wars result in the death of many civilians. Source D does not necessarily disagree with either the means or the ends of humanitarian intervention, but does agree with the fact that the ends used in Libya were unsuitable. Source C and source D disagree on the realities of these means and ends. Source D seems to suggest that the means for humanitarian intervention are usually appropriate and the justifications for war in the case of Libya were a product of many stars aligning. Source C suggests that the 'military means' are a persistent problem that is 'undermining our capacity to address growing insecurity'. 

Source C does not suggest that the ends for humanitarian intervention are nothing but humanitarian and lawful in reality. Source D's explicit references to the number of ends that live outside of humanitarianism seem to suggest that reality differs from strictly humanitarian ends. Source D mentions Gaddafi as a 'villain figure who had managed to alienate nearly all UN member states', the weakness of leaders in the middle east, a lack of interest from usual opposing veto powers, the smallness of Libya, and a convenient ground force to fight the war as potential legitimising factors for the case in Libya.
## 4. Using the sources and your own knowledge, evaluate the claim that violations of human rights are no guarantee that humanitarian intervention will take place.
1. Source D: humanitarian intervention and ulterior motives. Humanitarian reasoning must be paired with another motive to be justified by a state. the law!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2. Source C: "classic military means is undermining our capacity to address growing insecurity"
3. Source B: people within the state may not want humanitarian intervention
4. Source A: diplomacy is slow? choices to be made. 

Humanitarian intervention, according to Heywood, "is military intervention that is carried out in pursuit of humanitarian rather than strategic objectives" (Heywood 2014, p.326). Humanitarian intervention is contested and deeply controversial for a number of reasons (Heywood 2014, p.326). The validity of notion that violations of human rights are no guarantee that humanitarian intervention will occur is dependent the political theory you subscribe to.

A realist would believe that an altruistic view of humanitarian intervention is incompatible with the selfishness of the state system. The most basic realist values are those of self interest in all humans and within the state (Heywood 2014, p.14). Not only is the realist outlook incompatible with humanitarianism, it is absolutely incompatible with the notion that states may, without any other motive, decide to intervene in another state in order to achieve humanitarian ends. This realist view that utterly disagrees with humanitarian intervention is backed up by source D, which lists the many ulterior motives that led to a humanitarian intervention failure in Libya. The Libya incident does not exist in isolation either, the war on terror and 'liberal intervention' is riddled with ulterior motives (Heywood 2014, p.328-329), French intervention in Rwanda (Lamy 2016, p.268). This realist view of humanitarian intervention ends with the conclusion that humanitarian intervention cannot exist solely with humanitarian motives. It must come in conjunction or only with motives that benefit the intervening state. A liberal view of humanitarian intervention allows for the possibility of an intervention motivated only by humanitarian ends. 

Source C identifies a major issue with humanitarian intervention — it's militaristic nature. Source C states that "the problem with the military approach is that it reinforces division" between intervening parties and states subject to intervention. Source C states that military intervention is 'undermining' our ability to enact truly helpful humanitarian schemes. The poster in source B demonstrates this further within it's imagery of military tanks and helicopters stating: "NO FOREIGN INTERVENTION". The word foreign connotes a division between parties. This sentiment is shared among individuals subject to humanitarian intervention, Heywood states that "wars in Afghanistan and Iraq also in many ways deepened tensions between the Islamic world and the West". These wars were framed as humanitarian intervention by supporters (Heywood 2014, p.328). Anti intervention sentiments can become a blocking factor in true humanitarian intervention.
