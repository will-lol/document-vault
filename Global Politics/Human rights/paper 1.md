# Paper 1 â€” Humanitarian Intervention
## 1. Identify three main points made by U.S. President Barack Obama in Source A about the issue of international intervention in Libya.
1. International intervention has the ability to stop violence in Libya
2. International intervention must work in cooperation with Libya and not with military force to be successful
3. Using military power to overthrow the regime in Libya 'would be a mistake'. Non-military force is better in this case.
