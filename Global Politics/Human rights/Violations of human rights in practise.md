## Introduction to the issue
### DRC
The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the largest countries in land mass and population in Africa. The CIA world factbook reports that the country thrived through the 14 -> 19th centuries until it was colonised and the population experienced devastation due to disease and slave labour. 1960 was the year that marked independence for the Congo, but also many years of civil unrest that persists to this day. The country has been through two separate wars that have since officially ceased but violence in the region continues with over 100 different armed groups that are active to this day (CIA World Factbook, 2022). Soldiers to fight in the conflict are lacking, so many military groups, including the government, have resorted to the use of child soldiers in their activities. According to Unicef, children don't have agency in the decision to incorporate themselves into these groups. Unicef lists a number of roles that the 93,000 total child soldiers as of 2020 may take in the DRC:
- Combatants
- Transports
- Spies
- Chefs
- Sexual slaves
### Human rights
Human rights are a contested concept but in the modern, liberal world order the most accepted document in International Relations regarding Human Rights is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN declares these 4 principles of human rights: 
1. **Universality**
2. Interdependency
3. Indivisibility
4. Inalienability
The DRC is a part of the United Nations. According to the UN, they have been working in solidarity with the DRC to help keep peace. The UN has been unable to rectify the issue of child soldiers in the DRC as is proved by a report 3 weeks ago from the Washington Post on the matter, which may be a product of, according to Heywood, the UN's inconsistencies and biases with member states.
### Is this a problem?
#### A realist perspective
The extreme realist perspective believes that morality, and therefore human rights have absolutely no place in international politics (Heywood, 2014 p.317). Realists emphasise a concern for order and stability for citizens in a state (Heywood, 2014 p.317). Conflict is then undesirable but the use of child soldiers is neither clearly endorsed nor opposed.
#### A liberal perspective
According to Heywood, Human rights are a liberal construct. Since human rights are in violation in this situation, from a liberal perspective, child soldiers are absolutely a problem.
#### Critical views
An opposition to corporate globalism and a shift to equal distribution of economic and social resources includes the belief that if the most privileged children in this world are not routinely kidnapped to be a soldier, then no child should. Other critical views are not so clear in their views on this topic.
**Assuming a perspective in favour of human rights and morality in international relations, child soldiers are a problem**
### Physical documents
As far as International physical documents go, there are many documents that aim to protect children from becoming soldiers
- The UDHR states that soldiers must be at least 18 years of age for recruitment (UN, n.d.)
- The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that soldiers must be 18 years of age, in effect since 2002 (UN, n.d.)
- International Criminal Court defines an international humanitarian law (laws of armed conflict) states that soldiers must be at least 15 
These 3 documents very clearly state that children cannot be soldiers, yet, this practise continues in the DRC.
### Why are physical documents *not* working?
#### Is it cultural relativism? 
In the 2010 BBC show 'Kids with Guns: Stacey Dooley Investigates', Dooley investigates the situation in the DRC. It is clear to see from the program that while the concept of child soldiers is not uncommon and not shocking to those in the country, it isn't an issue of non-concern. Particularly for parents, it is devastating to lose their children. It is not as if this is commonly accepted practise in the DRC.
#### Is it a lack of resources to solve this problem?
The peacekeeping mission in the DRC is one of the largest in the world. The approved budget by the UN for one year of peacekeeping is over 1 billion dollars. However, the UN has recently reported that its operation has a 'lack of sufficient funding' (UN peacekeeping, 2022). This is due to a long decline in funding as the peacekeeping mission has been in operation for over 12 years, yet the situation has only improved marginally.
#### A lack of public conscience, the view of the DRC is a failed or helpless state and a tendency to only contain the issue not end it?
As Lamy points out in their "Introduction to Global Politics", humanitarian intervention is often a product of greater public 'humanitarian awareness' (Lamy *et al.*, 2020). This particular issue does not have much media attention outside of a handful of documentaries and articles. Another contributing factor here is the view of the DRC as a failed or helpless state (Freedman, 2015). This view allows "the Western urge to transform or ‘save’ the DRC and in the process legitimises interventions with reductionist explanations and causalities" and ulterior motives (Freedman, 2015 p.120). Other contributing factors include the pessimistic view of an otherwise resource rich and high potential state (BBC, 2019) that results in an ineffective mission to only contain or keep a level of peace rather than to leave the conflict and use of child soldiers in the past.
