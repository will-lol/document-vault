## Introduction
The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the largest countries in land mass and population in Africa. The country thrived through the 14th -> 19th centuries until it was colonised and the population was devastated due to disease and slave labour. 1960 was the year that marked independence for the Congo, but also many years of civil unrest that persists to this day. The country has been through two separate wars that have since ceased but the violence in the region continues with over 100 different armed groups that are active to this day. Willing soldiers to fight in these groups are lacking, so many of them have resorted to the use of child soldiers in their activities. Soldiers in these groups are subject to a myriad of human rights abuses, however, children are especially exploited in that they are underage and don't have agency in the decision to incorporate themselves into these groups.

Human rights are a contested concept but in the modern, liberal world order the most accepted document in International Relations is the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN declares that there are 4 principles of human rights: 
1. Universality
2. Interdependency
3. Indivisibility
4. Inalienability
The UDHR permits the use of soldiers generally but does not permit the human rights abuses to these soldiers and especially does not permit the use of children as soldiers. The United Nations has one of its largest peacekeeping operations in the DRC but have failed to eliminate this particular issue.
