## Introduction to the issue
### DRC
The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the largest countries in land mass and population in Africa. The CIA world factbook reports that the country thrived through the 14th -> 19th centuries until it was colonised and the population was devastated due to disease and slave labour. 1960 was the year that marked independence for the Congo, but also many years of civil unrest that persists to this day. The country has been through two separate wars that have since ceased but the violence in the region continues with over 100 different armed groups that are active to this day. Willing soldiers to fight in these groups are lacking, so many of them have resorted to the use of child soldiers in their activities. Soldiers in these groups are subject to a myriad of human rights abuses such as, however, as Unicef reports, children are especially exploited in that they are underage and don't have agency in the decision to incorporate themselves into these groups. Unicef lists a number of roles that the 5000 to 1000 child soldiers as of 2018 may take in the DRC:
- Combatants
- Transports
- Spies
- Chefs
- Sexual slaves
### Human rights
Human rights are a contested concept but in the modern, liberal world order the most accepted document in International Relations is the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN declares that there are 4 principles of human rights: 
1. **Universality**
2. Interdependency
3. Indivisibility
4. Inalienability
The DRC is a part of the United Nations who, according to the UN, has been helping the state to keep peace. The UN has been unable to rectify the issue of child soldiers in the DRC as is proved by a report 3 weeks ago from the Washington Post on the matter, which may be a product of, according to Heywood, the UN's inconsistencies and biases with member states.
### Is this a problem?
#### A realist perspective
The extreme realist perspective believes that morality, and therefore human rights have absolutely no place in international politics (Heywood 2014 p.317). Realists emphasise a concern for order and stability for citizens in a state, not necessarily morality (Heywood 2014 p.317). While conflict in a state is then undesirable but the use of child soldiers is neither endorsed nor opposed.
#### A liberal perspective
According to Heywood, Human rights are a liberal construct and human rights are in violation in this situation meaning that from a liberal perspective, child soldiers are absolutely a problem.
#### Critical views
An opposition to corporate globalism and a shift to equal distribution of economic and social resources includes the belief that if the most privileged in this world are not routinely kidnapped to be a soldier, then no one should. Other critical views are not so clear in their views on this topic.
### Physical documents
As far as International physical documents go, there are many documents that aim to protect child soldiers
- The UDHR states that soldiers must be at least 18 years of age for recruitment (UN, n.d.)
- The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that soldiers must be 18 years of age, in effect since 2002 (UN, n.d.)
- International Criminal Court defines an international humanitarian law (laws of armed conflict) states that soldiers must be at least 15 
These 3 documents very clearly state that children cannot be soldiers, yet, this practise continues in the DRC.

### Why are physical documents *not* working?
#### Is it cultural relativism? 
In the 2010 BBC show 'Kids with Guns: Stacey Dooley Investigates', Dooley investigates the situation in the DRC. It is clear to see from the program that while the concept of child soldiers is not uncommon and not shocking to those in the country, it isn't an issue of non-concern. Particularly for parents, it is devastating to lose their children. It is not as if this is commonly accepted practise in the DRC.
#### Is it a lack of resources to solve this problem?
The peacekeeping mission in the DRC is one of the largest in the world. The approved budget by the UN for one year of peacekeeping is over 1 billion dollars. However, the UN has recently reported that its operation has a 'lack of sufficient funding' (UN peacekeeping, 2022). This is due to a long decline in funding as the peacekeeping mission has been in operation for over 12 years, yet the situation has only improved marginally.
#### A lack of public conscience, the view of the DRC as a failed or helpless state, incentive to only contain the issue not end it, ?
