## What is humanitarian intervention and how does it relate to human rights?
Intervention is the forcible action taken by one state against another state, without the latter's consent. Humanitarian intervention is thought of to be the justifiable type of intervention, because on the grounds of helping people in need it is ethically more correct to intervene on a state's sovereignty. It relates to human rights as it is supposedly the protection of people from violations of these rights. Humanitarian intervention as Martha Finnemore states is “our obligation to save people”, from violations in human rights.   
## Why did humanitarian interventions increase so markedly in the 1990s?
The ‘golden age of humanitarian intervention’ was marked by the end of the cold war and a shift from power politics (that power is the root of all war and system instability) to liberal peace fueled by diplomacy, collective action and international standards of morality (such as the UDHR). 4 factors contributed to the increase in humanitarian intervention:

1. Humanitarian and state interests often overlap
2. Rise in mass media and coverage of humanitarian crisis’ caused increased public pressure on governments to intervene
3. The end of cold war rivalry and the emergence of the US as the sole superpower in the world (allowing it to determine universal moralities and standards as discussed earlier)
4. High expectations for the UDHR puts lawmakers into action.

## Is military intervention ever truly 'humanitarian'?
None of the forms of military intervention were ever considered to be purely humanitarian. As India and Vietnam justify military intervention in terms of national interest and need to restore regional stability. So military intervention is considered to be a more selfish form of humanitarian intervention.  It is thought now, in the modernising world after the Cold War, that military humanitarian intervention is the least appropriate form of intervention. During the 1990s military intervention was only taken in emergency conditions with the intention of restoring peace and order”. While this is often not thought of as the case anymore, and doesn’t seem to work. There are selfish intentions behind ‘humanitarian intervention’, realists are arguing that it is for the state.
## Can humanitarian intervention ever be reconciled with the norm of state sovereignty?
Humanitarian reasons can give states a ‘right to intervene’ which may be abused due to the common collision between human rights and state interests. This collision of interests and lack of incentive outside of state sovereignty means that it is difficult to separate the two.
## Does humanitarian intervention merely reinforce global power asymmetries?
Realists and neorealists tend to argue that humanitarian intervention is overlapped by national interests on those who are intervening. The motives behind the intervention are ambiguous and questionable as well as complex. As generally states will intervene to protect or support something for their own self interests: such as protecting against refugees and preventing regional instability.  Only those who have interest in protecting their sovereignties and other aspects of national security will intervene on humanitarian events. Only those who have enough power to do so will intervene, further emphasising the power asymmetries on the global stage. 
## Is humanitarian intervention justified? What are the arguments 'for' versus those 'against'?

|**For**|**Against**|
| :-: | :-: |
|**Indivisibility of universal morals** – Humanitarian intervention is based upon the principle of human rights: indivisibility, that human rights cannot be confined to one's own state and that states should have an obligation to save fellow states.|**Violations of international law** – International law only authorises intervention in the case of defence.|
|**Global interdependence** – Humanitarian intervention may be justified on the grounds of indirect threats to sovereignty.|**National self-interests** – Humanitarian intervention is always biassed and has an ulterior motive that is different from humanitarian morals.|
|**Promoting democracy** – Promote democracy to those unable to ‘alleviate’ their hardship.|**Double standards** – Sometimes humanitarian intervention is ruled out on the basis of no incentive|
|**International community** – Humanitarian intervention is ‘demonstrable evidence’ of the communities commitment to the UDHR and shared humanitarian morals. |**Simplistic view of politics** – Good (state intervening) vs evil (state being intervened with)|
||**Moral pluralism** – Humanitarian intervention enforces a universal view of humanitarianism that may not be applicable in some areas.|

## Why might humanitarian intervention often be the cause of protests and controversy?
There can be controversy in what counts as a humanitarian intervention because of the motives behind the actions. For example, many scholars question the integrity and actions that were behind the interventions during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Strictly speaking, neither was a “humanitarian intervention”. As in both cases, the primary justification for the military action was for self-defence after the attacks of 9/11. However, there are protests regarding the nature of humanitarian interventions of this example because the repressive force of the Taliban restricted many aspects of human rights of the people living in that country and therefore people argue that it was humanitarian intervention. 

There are a lot of protests regarding the nature of humanitarian intervention, as some argue that there is too much and there is too much interference with internal affairs.
