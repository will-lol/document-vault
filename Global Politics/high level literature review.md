# Higher Level Literature Review
## Chosen study
The 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
## Research question
What role do governments, IGOs, NGOs and MNCs have in forming global public health responses to disasters?
## Global political challenge
The global politics challenge associated with this case study is 'health'. 

Health is a political challenge in all parts of the world. It has very real consequences for everyone. Politics concerns health in many ways. In developed countries, issues in health might be related to a balance between the public and private sector or it might be to do with funding. In Global Politics however, it is more important to consider the extent to which everyone is in good health and has access to health care. 

The Democratic Republic of Congo and its many Ebola outbreaks is demonstrative of this baseline health system. The health of people in the DRC, according to the WHO is 'alarming'. Government health expenditure is rather lacking at only US$20 per capita as compared to the world average of US$1121 (World Bank 2019). The lack of health spending in the DRC makes it vulnerable to disease outbreaks. 

The 2018 -> 2020 Ebola outbreak required the assistance of many foreign actors to contain. The assistance had mixed results for many reasons. The assistance provided by these actors sets a precedent for the baseline level of global public health.

There is a clear link between this case study and the global political challenge of health. It covers the lack of public health in developing countries and the need for a level of global public health. This case study is representative of the roles that many different actors play in influencing health response and some of the unintended consequences of involving foreign actors in health responses.

This particular case is overshadowed by the many other Ebola outbreaks in the DRC that have preceded it. To further understand the issue of global public health, the COVID-19 response in big developing countries such as Nigeria is also worth looking at. Issues with Ebola in Sierra Leone mirror the outbreak in the DRC (Mayhew et al. 2021)

The wider issues relevant in understanding this case are issues of development and equality. Health outcomes in the world are far from equal and are largely tied to nationality and wealth. As states develop, their population's health outcomes increase.

The Ebola virus in the DRC and its response has global significance. It has local ramifications on the community level in terms of lost family members and the legacy that this event will hold. On the regional level might be a fear that the virus spreads to neighbouring states by mass migration (Kalenga et al. 2019). On a more global scale however, this case study contributes to an expected level of global public health for citizens of developing states.
## Causes, consequences, responses
What factors are causing this situation? What are the political, social and economic impacts of the issue at various levels of global politics on various actors and stakeholders? What are the various responses to the issue at various levels of global politics by various actors and stakeholders? How do interpretations of the issue vary by actor and stakeholder?

The exact causes of this particular Ebola outbreak are unknown. However, it is known that the Ebola virus disease most commonly transfers to humans when they come into contact with an infected animal (Muyembe et al. 2012).
