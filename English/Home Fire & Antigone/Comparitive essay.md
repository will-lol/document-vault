## Evidence
### Home Fire
"When it came to his son, Karamat had always treated “well intentioned” as good enough. With his daughter, the only other possible candidate for such preferential treatment, there’d never been any need." p.213

"few understood Britain as well as Karamat Lone" p.214

"You’re doing the contemptuous thing again, Terry would say."

"People were usually so predictable" p.216

"physically restrained from returning to the arms of that manipulative whore" p.216

"His wife had always had a perfectly judged sense of who he was, who he had to be, as a public figure, which made it all the more mystifying when she packed up a segment of his wardrobe and moved it down to the basement bedroom in response to his office’s breaking the story of Eamonn’s involvement with the girl. You could have protected him, she’d said, as if her husband were the kind of man either stupid or unethical enough to try to organize a cover-up." p.217 

"Pivoting away from Suarez, he sent the paper cup flying in the direction of the garbage can. It hit the rim, bounced up, plummeted into the receptacle.
Take out the trash. Keep Britain clean." p.219

""Everyone should know better," Karamat said" p.221

""Shut up", Karamat shouted, to everything." p.223 

"Even the chancer had to lean across the space vacated by the PM as he stood at the dispatch box and pat Karamat appreciatively on the shoulder, a tiny nerve pulsing near his eye, which he saw Karamat recognize as defeat." p. 226

"Intervene on decency’s behalf. What kind of madness makes someone leave a corpse out in the heat to putrefy?" (Karamat) p.227
"The madness of love. Remember your Laila-Majnu, Karamat? The lover so grief-stricken at the loss of the beautiful beloved that he wanders, in madness, in the desert. This beautiful girl in a dust storm has managed to become Laila and Majnu combined in the nation’s consciousness. Or Sassi and Punnu in parts of the nation—same story, except it’s the girl who runs grief-crazed through the desert in search of her love." (Pakistan high commissioner) p.227-228

"The owner of the city’s largest ice factory said he would supply his product free of charge, a truck driver said he would transport it as a religious duty. Everyone who had gathered in the park took turns unloading the ice slabs and passing them along a conveyer belt of human hands to the white sheet, now soaked through." p.228-229

"With respect, sir, he is your son."
