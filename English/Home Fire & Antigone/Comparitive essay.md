listening to people close to you (family)
echo chambers
patriotism/the state

## Evidence

"When it came to his son, Karamat had always treated “well intentioned” as good enough. With his daughter, the only other possible candidate for such preferential treatment, there’d never been any need." p.213

You could have protected him, she’d said, as if her husband were the kind of man either stupid or unethical enough to try to organize a cover-up." p.217

"The madness of love. Remember your Laila-Majnu, Karamat? The lover so grief-stricken at the loss of the beautiful beloved that he wanders, in madness, in the desert. This beautiful girl in a dust storm has managed to become Laila and Majnu combined in the nation’s consciousness. Or Sassi and Punnu in parts of the nation—same story, except it’s the girl who runs grief-crazed through the desert in search of her love." (Pakistan high commissioner) p.227-228

"The owner of the city’s largest ice factory said he would supply his product free of charge, a truck driver said he would transport it as a religious duty. Everyone who had gathered in the park took turns unloading the ice slabs and passing them along a conveyer belt of human hands to the white sheet, now soaked through." p.228-229

"personal animus" "He knew it to be a lie" p.245

"James, until this thing is over I don’t have a son and I don’t have a wife. I have a great office of state. Are we clear?" p.246

"His family. His goddamned family and they were the ones least able to understand." p.252

"A way to stop drinking the jammy liquid and make it her fault." p.252
