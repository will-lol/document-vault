### Refer to:
- The context of composition

### Pride definition: 
A high, esp. an excessively high, opinion of one's own worth or importance which gives rise to a feeling or attitude of superiority over others; inordinate self-esteem.
### My position: 
#### The ways

#### The warning
listening to people close to you (family)
echo chambers
patriotism/the state
pride creates intolerance 
hubris 
righteousness
attributes of a great leader

- willing to hear people and listen

	The danger of pride is that it blinds one to ones own weaknesses and creates intolerances to other perspectives due to righteousness.
