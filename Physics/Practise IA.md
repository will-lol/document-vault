# Determining a distance between two sound sources for an ideal intensity across an area.
## Introduction
I first encountered the concept of dual source interference in class. It fascinated me the wave would almost disappear in the areas of destructive interference. In learning that dual source interference applies to sound waves, I wondered about outdoor concerts or events where two sound sources are placed some distance apart if part of the audience would be unable to hear the sound at all. My curiosity prompted me to investigate this using a simulation.
## Research question
How does the distance between two sound sources effect the intensity of the sound heard across an area.
## Theory and hypothesis 
### Dual source interference
Dual source interference is based upon the principal of superposition â€” that when two waves meet the resulting wave has a displacement that is the sum of the displacement of the two waves. Imagine two identical sources close together with wavefronts radiating out from them (solid lines). Also imagine wavefronts that show the minimums of the wave (dotted lines). Where the dotted lines meet the solid lines is a point of destructive interference and where either solid lines meet solid lines or dotted lines meet dotted lines are points of constructive interference.

These points of constructive and destructive interference form lines. These are called nodal for constructive interference and anti-nodal lines for destructive. These lines stay in place as the wave moves.
