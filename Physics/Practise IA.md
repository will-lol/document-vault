# How does the radius of a balloon affect its terminal velocity?
## Introduction

## Research Question
I want to explore the relationship between the volume of gas (exhaled air) in a ballon and its terminal velocity. Measuring the volume of air in a balloon is mathematically challenging, so the radius may be a more fitting measurement. Terminal velocity is also possible to measure using a camera because the balloon reaches 95%+ terminal velocity very quickly. My question therefore is:

**How does the radius of a balloon affect its terminal velocity?**
## Theory and Hypothesis 
The following is a force diagram of a balloon falling through air:
![[balloonforce.svg]]There are 3 forces acting on the balloon: weight, air resistance and buoyancy. The balloon reaches a terminal velocity, meaning that the net force acting on the balloon is 0.
### Weight
To find the weight of these balloons we must know the mass. The mass of the balloons depends on the volume of exhaled air in the balloons. According to BBC bitesize and Engineering toolbox, the composition of exhaled air is as follows: 
|         Gas         | Percent in exhaled air (BBC Bitesize) | Density at NTP/STP (Engineering toolbox) |
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:| ---------------------------------------- |
|    Nitrogen, N2     |            79%             | 1.165 kgm<sup>-3</sup>                             |
|     Oxygen, O2      |            16%             | 1.331 kgm<sup>-3</sup>                             |
| Carbon dioxide, CO2 |             4%             | 1.842 kgm<sup>-3</sup>                             |
|        Other        |             1%             |                                          |
Assuming that the balloons are spherical and at STP, we can generate a formula for relating the radius of the balloon to its weight. The mass of an empty ballon is 0.004kg. 
$W=mg$,  $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2$, $m=V\times\rho$, $g=9.81$
$$ m=0.004 + 1.165((\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2) \times 0.79) + 1.331((\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2 \times 0.16) + 1.842((\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2 \times 0.04) $$
$$ W = 9.81(0.004 + 1.165((\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2) \times 0.79) + 1.331((\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2 \times 0.16) + 1.842((\frac{4}{3}\pi r^2 \times 0.04))$$
