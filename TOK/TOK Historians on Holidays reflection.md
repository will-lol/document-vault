# Historians on Holidays reflection
## What did you learn about the nature of knowledge in history and the methods used by historians to substantiate knowledge claims? 

### How are claims about events, the causes of events and the significance of events different? 
Claims about events are the root for all of the other speculation and analysis about causes and significance. For this reason, they need to be objective and grounded in the most evidence. Claims about the causes of events are often speculative and contested because they are often the result of analysis of the events themselves, rather than new evidence. Claims about the causes of events can drastically change the overall picture of an event and are interlinked closely with the significance of events. 

Claims about the significance of events differ further because when talking about history, we have the wisdom of hindsight to make claims about the significance of events. Claims about the significance of events are the linking between the event itself and the consequences of it in the present.
### Do you better understand your classmate as a result of historical inquiry? 
Even though my historical inquiry did not result in much in the way of a clear picture of Lucia's particular day, I felt as if I had a deeper understanding of Lucia's interests and daily life as a whole. It was interesting to see the inside of someone else's life, making me realise that the way I live my life is drastically different to others. My assumptions that I had to make in analysis Lucia's day were often wrong, I now realise that these assumptions were derived from my own life experience and it is wrong to attempt to apply them to everyone.
### Use TOK concepts such as objectivity, subjectivity, certainty, interpretation, evidence, speculation, values, perspectives, etc. in your answer.
