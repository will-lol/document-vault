# How do we distinguish between good and bad interpretations of artworks?
## The authority of the interpretation determines it's validity
Looking for authority is one way we can distinguish between good and bad interpretations of artworks. There is no definition of authority in the arts that has consensus but the authority of an interpretation is informally determined by the interpreters wealth, experience and connections in the field of art they interpret in. Examples of generally accepted authoritative interpreters include art critics, music reviewers, artists themselves and prolific art purchasers.
