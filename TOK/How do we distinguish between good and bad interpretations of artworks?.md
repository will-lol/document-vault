## The authority of the interpretation determines it's validity
Looking for authority is one way we may be able to distinguish between good and bad interpretations of artworks. The authority of an interpretation is informally determined by the interpreter's wealth, experience and connections in the field of art they interpret in. Examples of generally accepted authoritative interpreters include art critics, music reviewers, artists, and prolific art purchasers.  
### Example 1 (supporting)
Judging an interpretation based upon its authority works in some cases. Beethoven's 'Eroica' is often praised by music reviewers as a turning point in western music history (NPR 2006), it was voted the greatest symphony of all time by 151 conductors at BBC Music Magazine (Brown 2016). As is evident from western popular music, Beethoven's work is not preferable to listen to for most western people — it brings joy mostly to those that understand the complexity of his work. Critics and authoritative interpretations bring a level of understanding that Beethoven's music is technically impressive and 'good' to those that do not understand.
### Example 2 (challenging)
In Beethoven's case, interpreters have the benefit of hindsight to see the vast effects of it within greater temporal parameters. Interpreters of Andy Warhol did not have this hindsight and were missing much of the grounds for his greatness (influencing emerging genres of art) which arrived in subsequent decades. Interpretations of Warhol's art were very critical at the time because of a sheer lack of technical skill — Warhol would copy and print commercial art as his own (The Art Assignment 2015). Warhol's art would have looked 'bad' in comparison to the technical complexity of art from Paris or even other artists in NYC. 
### Miniture conclusion
Warhol and Beethoven's art combine to form a picture of authoritative interpretations that positions them as interpretations based on comparisons streaming from their knowledge in the field and evaluations of technical complexity. 
## Subjectivism
Subjectivism is an alternative way to view interpretations: no single or combination of interpretations is solely correct. Subjectivism is helpful in some ways but is sometimes incompatible with ethics.
### Example 3 (supporting)
Mark Rothko is an artist whose works rely heavily on subjectivism. His artworks may seem to have little meaning on the surface but are extremely considered in every detail. In Rothko's art, knowledge is extracted by each individual that views his art rather than him applying knowledge to them. The simplicity of Rothko's art makes interpretations very diverse, his art broadly conveys emotions and ideas that are applicable to everyone. Subjectivism works in Rothko's art, people are able to extract their own knowledge from the simple ideas that Rothko puts forward. 
### Example 4 (challenging)
 Controversial Spanish artist Santiago Sierra was involved in the 2021 Tasmanian Dark Mofo Festival in his piece of performance art 'Union Jack' that, according to the ABC was to be "used to soak a British flag [with the blood of first nations peoples], as an artistic metaphor" (Cascone 2021). The premise was met with very little support due to the unethical nature of a coloniser using the blood of the colonised for the success of an event organised by colonisers (Walsh 2021). True subjectivism validates all interpretations of artworks without any other considerations. Questions of ethics can mean that holding an interpretation that opposes the ethical consensus invalidates one's interpretation, and often for good reason. This means that if ethics should be a consideration in art knowledge, then true subjectivism is not true. 
### Miniture conclusion
Subjectivism allows one to form their own interpretation and knowledge around an artwork without restraints, which is good in that art becomes more universal and knowledge ridden. However, true subjectivism requires ethics to not be a consideration, which makes it unfeasible in the eyes of many people.
## Conclusion
Distinguishing between good and bad interpretations does not work entirely in either of the perspectives put forward. Subjectivism allows diverse interpretations but it is in jeopardy with ethics and the only benefit that authoritative interpretations put forward is familiarity with the genre (enabling comparisons to other artworks and evaluation of technical ability). Possibly both of these perspectives could combine to even their pitfalls and create an interactive space where good and bad interpretations are determined by consensus. The interpretations of individuals and critics are averaged and the result becomes a model interpretation that may not be correct for everyone but provides a baseline for comparison.
