## The morning:
2. 'The Great Gatsby' is a novel that Lucia is reading, possibly in the morning. She is clearly interested in the book, highlightions and annotations are rife. 
	1. Cause: Reading is a passion of Lucia's. 
3. Lucia has an interest in line drawings using pen. She completes 3 drawings of women. The drawings seem to have no connection to the texts that she is reading
	
## The afternoon:
5. This day clearly consists of some school work. Lucia is memorising lines for the play "The IT" by Vivienne Franzmann
6. "Impromptu" by Tad Mosel is another play that Lucia presents. This seems to be a play that has been less developed in her drama class since the annotations are fewer
## The evening:
8. Lucia finishes the schoolwork and moves to some leisure activities. 
9. The doll that Lucia presents may be part of these activities.
